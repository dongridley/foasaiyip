The fact that the Windows App SDK is no longer supported by AMD makes it look like they are dropping OpenCL. OpenCL support for GPUs is still same and the support always comes with the driver itself.

I am trying to make a flash drive installation for Monero mining on AMD GPU. I decided to use Manjaro as the distro, as it is usually very simple to set up. I used Manjaro Architect to install a CLI system with no GUI stuff. I installed the 4.15 kernel package, as I have a Vega64 card and I need the new AMDGPU DC code to get output on my screen when I boot from the flash drive. I did not have a spare flash drive to put the ISO image on, so I installed manjaro from a QEMU VM on my laptop Mercury Playback Engine - это движок с поддержкой GPU Nvidia CUDA + центральный процессор (поддержка многопоточности) + эффективная работа с памятью 64-битного приложения.

I am using a single Radeon 5830 video card. From what I've read, ATI Stream version 2.1 will give the most M/hash with this card. However, if I use the standalone installer for ATI Stream 2.1 for Windows 7 x64 ( from here ( guiminer will report no OpenCL devices found.

I use Agisoft Metashape (nee Photoscan) a lot, and after watching the progress of AMD's open sauce integration, I treated myself to an RX 570 8GB at Christmas to replace an aging 750 ti. I quickly found out that the transition to AMD wasn't going to be quite as easy as I had anticipated. Agisoft failed to detect the card and the culprit was a lack of OpenCL. I'm fairly certain that early on in my reading up of the issue, I'd read that the AMDGPU-PRO implementation of OpenCL was better for compu. Эта таблица содержит основную информацию о графических процессорах NVIDIA серии GeForce и видеокартах, построенных на официальных спецификациях NVIDIA. Getting your Windows machine ready for OpenCL is rather straightforward. In short, you only need the latest drivers for your OpenCL. I know, this is an unpopular opinion, but I will give you reasons, why I think so. The preface Today I got all the parts for my new render PC, my first experiment using a mini PC with an Intel Celeron has failed due to really insufficent power. After looking around and taking some advice on reddit, I decided to get a AMD Ryzen 3 2200G with integrated Vega 3 graphics card. The CPU is really fast in rendering but it was way slower than I expected, so I checked around. It was missing OpenCL.

Current Shot in the dark but worth trying - for context I’m interested in doing dev work with OpenCL but currently have a GIGABYTE Nvidia 1060 3GB, and that doesn’t support OpenCL (annoyingly). I really fancy an AMD 2600X (if ignoring the upcoming 3000-series chips) but am aware it doesn’t (officially) support OpenCL either. Does anyone know on whether I could make it work? I’ve heard you can treat a 2600X as an Intel CPU since it implements SSE instructions but I’ve not tried that before. Home > Blog > OpenCL™ and the AMD APP SDK v2.4.

Has anyone been able to get opencl to work on vega cards on 16.04. 
Ah here we are, with AMD it's trickiest! The most important thing is that your system must be clean of NVIDIA display driver residues. If, like me, you have both ATI and NVIDIA drivers on your system, the GPU code path of AMD's OpenCL won't work. I guess no one seems to be missing it since it took this long to be discovered, or, lets just say, to be discussed widely? amp#x200B; https://community.amd.com/thread/231410 (https://community.amd.com/thread/231410) amp#x200B; (Source: https://www.planet3dnow.de/cms/44688-hat-amd-den-opencl-support-fuer-cpus-gestrichen/ (https://www.planet3dnow.de/cms/44688-hat-amd-den-opencl-support-fuer-cpus-gestrichen/)). On a Windows 10 system with an AMD Radeon GPU and an Intel GPU (desktop or notebook), with graphics drivers installed for both GPUs, I bet you will see that OpenCL is limited to the AMD GPU only. If you search for Intel OpenCL related files with Explorer or Regedit, you will quickly. I am looking to purchase a new graphics card to start working on neural networks and GPGPU projects Which is a better overall choice, does the amount of on-card ram make a difference?

This work is done in Windows 10. We also regularly do deep learning stuff, which I hope to do in my dual booted (X)ubuntu partition. I also want to do some development on CUDA / OpenCL, which (for CUDA) I understand points towards GeForce cards. I recently discovered about eGPUs, and is very inter.

I just wanted to ask if there is a working AMD graphics driver out there with OpenCL 1.2? I'm running 2 HD 7950, with the Radeon driver. I had to blacklist the amdgpu driver because I only end up with a whitescreen after boot with it enabled. I found this (https://www.reddit.com/r/openSUSE/comments/7hzxer/tumbleweed_amdgpu_amdgpupro_opencl_stack/) but the amdgpu driver isn't working 
OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a new heterogeneous computing environment, that runs on the CUDA architecture. It will allow developers to harness the massive parallel computing power of NVIDIA GPU's to create compelling computing applications. The closest I got to getting this functioning was by installing a random amd opencl driver 'opencl-amd' from the AUR, none of the opencl drivers seem to work, they all give me: `amdgpu_device_initialize: drm version is 2.50.0 but this driver is only compatible with 3.x.x.` When using the opencl-catalyst drivers I get: /xmr-stak-amd: /opt/cuda/lib64/libOpenCL.so.1: no version information available (required by /xmr-stak-amd) /xmr-stak-amd: /opt/cuda/lib64/libOpenCL.so.1: no version. Прошло уже больше года с того момента, как в MQL5 появилась нативная поддержка OpenCL. Однако еще далеко не все пользователи оценили по достоинству возможность. 
I have seen this question many times but never found an answer for Windows. I recently ported my CUDA code to OpenCL. When testing with an ATI card, the Catalyst drivers contain a CPU OpenCL driver. I'd been happily mining with a variety of Nvidia GPU's. I sold all except a single 1050 Ti earlier this year. I wanted to get a good price for my old GPU's and it put me into a decent profit overall. Nothing too big. Enough to be worth doing. Always liked using Nvidia purely for simplicity. I picked up an AMD RX580 this weekend for about the same price as a 1050 Ti is now. I thought it would be a good swap to sell the 1050 Ti and have something a bit nicer to game on and maybe a doubling The proprietary AMDGPU-PRO drivers only support a select small subset of Linux distributions. Non-LTS Ubuntu releases aren't supported, and Debian users are completely out of luck. To make things worse, AMD doesn't provide OpenCL support through their open source drivers. There. I've read that the Nitro RX480 and RX590 don't, so I'm wondering if also the case with the 580. If you have the card, could you specify the version you have? (normal, special edition, or limited edition) Are you able to both reboot the VM and restart it (shut down completely and start it again) without needing to reboot

So with the imminent launching or VEGA 7nm, which is aimed at DL/AI/ML. all that good stuffs, AMD hopes to take away some of Nvidia's power in that area. Problem is the word "hope", because as of right now, Nvidia literally dominates this field. Almost every project I find on github, for my Computer Vision course at least, supports only cuDNN. A few of them support or have a fork supports OpenCL, but literally NONE supports MIOpen, which is AMD's in-house weapon against cuDNN. Amd Opencl 2 0 Driver The AMD OpenCL. AMD products.

Hello again, Since it is not possible to install the proprietary AMDGPU-PRO driver on Fedora as it has been said on my last post, I now would like to only install the proprietary OpenCL part of AMDGPU-PRO on Fedora.

I just switched from a GTX 960 to an AMD RX 580, I would like to report some issues in order to help other people in a similar situation decide: 1. mpv had issues with Wayland like vaapi not working and lack of windows decorations; 2. fullscreen video playing in standard X sessions has severe screen tearing, I found workarounds using \_NET\_WM\_BYPASS\_COMPOSITOR and x11-bypass-compositor=never in mpv.
